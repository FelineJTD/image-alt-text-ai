I received my Aquapure device last week and absolutely love it!! Even my skeptical husband is impressed with how well it works, and how much better and cleaner our produce tastes. Thus far, we've used it on blueberries, blackberries, apples, tomatoes, and various lettuces -- we could literally see the dirt and debris being lifted away, even after we'd already washed the items the way we would have in the past (produce wash and tap water). I'm planning to purchase several of these as holiday gifts for friends and family members this year. Also, I emailed customer service to ask a couple of clarifying questions about how to clean the device after use, and received very prompt and helpful responses. Finally, we've been using the Aquapure several times a day for the past week, and still have not had to recharge the battery, which I appreciate as well. Dee  Verified Buyer  5.0 star ratingNecessity in my kitchen! I normally use ACV and water to clean my veggies but ACV is getting expensive and this eco-friendly product lasts many years, plus with no vinegar smell or taste residue left behind. I love watching it do its job, it\u2019s so satisfying to see all of the gunk it removes. Definitely a necessity in my kitchen! Abby Gomez  Verified Buyer  5.0 star ratingVery clean produce! I noticed a lot of flecks in the water after using Aquapure. It looked like fine sand (small amount) after cleaning strawberries. I clean even my prewashed produce. This product gives me confidence that my produce is very clean. Flavor is good too. Susanne S.  Verified Buyer  5.0 star ratingGame Changer I have a bad habit of not washing my vegetables enough. So, this gives me the peace of mind that my fruits and veggies are getting clean, without having to manually wash each by hand. I love the convenience and it is easy to use!

Rutger's father loved the machine and felt healthier almost immediately.The only catch? It cost $6,000\u2026 and it was HUGE! Rutger wanted to recommend the machine to others who were worried about the toxins they consume, but the price tag held him back.But then, a few years later, major breakthroughs in electrolysis technology finally made it possible to create a MUCH cheaper and more portable version of the same technology. Rutger immediately went to work with top experts to create a consumer-friendly version that anyone could use\u2026 and AquaPure was born!Your Satisfaction Is Our PriorityTry AquaPure risk-free and if you don\u2019t love it, we\u2019ll fix it. 90-DAY MONEY BACK GUARANTEE If for any reason you\u2019re not 100% satisfied with AquaPure, you can easily return it, hassle-free!
