These conditions are incredibly common, yet many women are afraid to talk about how bad they are feeling due to the shame and stigma surrounding maternal mental health, or they don\u2019t know where to go or who to turn to. PMADs include a number of different symptoms and diagnoses, including prenatal and postpartum anxiety, postpartum depression, postpartum OCD, postpartum PTSD, and postpartum psychosis. PMADs can strike at any time during pregnancy and up to one year postpartum. Despite the catch-all term \u201cpostpartum depression,\u201d 50% of all PMAD cases develop during pregnancy. Here is some more information about PMADs:\n\n\nTragically, mental health issues including suicide are the leading cause of maternal mortality in New York City, and across the country.\nPMADs are the leading cause of maternal death in the U.S.\nPMADs far exceed the rates of gestational diabetes, hypertension, and other conditions that affect pregnant women.

That\u2019s why The Motherhood Center strives to make all therapeutic services as accessible and accommodating as possible for parents of all identities and backgrounds. We acknowledge that not all pregnant people identify as women, and thus encourage LGBTQIA+ pregnant and postpartum people to seek clinical care with us and join our community. The Motherhood Center is a place to talk about the hard parts of parenting as they intersect with race, identity, gender, sexual orientation, and other important aspects of identity. Our commitment is to be an anti-racist / anti-oppressive organization. No matter how you identify, The Motherhood Center is here for you.\n\n\n\n\n\nSupport Groups\nThe Motherhood Center offers an array of virtual support groups for new and expecting birthing people.\nLearn more\n\n\n\n\n\nPMAD Education\nLearn about the different types of perinatal mood and anxiety disorders.\nFor Parents\nFor Providers\n\n\n\n\n\nPMAD Stories\nA mixed media collection of real stories from perinatal mood and anxiety disorder survivors.\nLearn more\n\n\n\n\n\nTestimonials\n\n\nprevious slidenext slide\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cThe PHP has been a trusted space where I felt very held and cared for. I came to the PHP feeling extremely desperate, anxious and scared and after one day I knew I had come to the right place. I felt a weight had been lifted as I was relieved because I knew I would get help here. Trust the doctors, trust the therapy and talk to your fellow cohort members. Healing is not a switch you can turn on and off, but you can learn how to exist and thrive in the in between.
