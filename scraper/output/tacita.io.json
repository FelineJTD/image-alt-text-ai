The results of this assessment provide actionable outcomes and ensure we keep on track to assure maintenance of  a GDPR compliant environment and in addition, we can demonstrate due diligence by having an expert third party review how we manage GDPR.Ellis Bryant, Global Data Privacy OfficerSysco CorporationWe engaged Tacita to conduct a review of five Sysco companies to assess our overall compliance with GDPR. The Tacita team were efficient and helpful throughout the process and coordinated the assessments for all companies well. The extensive resources and tools provided have proven incredibly valuable in enhancing our compliance programme further.   Ed Johnson, CEOPushFarTacita have been fantastic to work with and the obvious choice for us two years running... Using Tacita gives both us and our clients complete peace of mind and assurance that what we are doing is the best it possibly can be at PushFar. \n\nIn a world where data compliance is of vital importance, Tacita are the perfect partners for us.Andy Keen-Downs, CEOPrison Advice and Care TrustTacita was hugely supportive in helping us to fine tune our policies and processes within a challenging time frame. Team members were knowledgeable and eager to engage staff, and this has ensured that we can continue to embrace a strong data protection culture across all aspects of our work as a charity. We look forward to continuing our journey with Tacita over the next 12 months.Mark Fitzgibbon, Privacy ManagerAPI3Tacita makes GDPR compliance easy since their expertise, resources and support are Gold Standard. \nWe've found that working with them has let us achieve a very high level of compliance, for both our products and our organisation, and has been highly effective.  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLatest GDPR news \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n \n\nSchrems II Shakes Up Data Privacy: A Landmark Legal Battle for the Digital Age\n\nTacita has undertaken a large number of assessments and we are still finding that many companies have no knowledge of the Schrems 2 ruling that means that Privacy Shield cannot be relied on for transfers of personal data to the US. Thus we believe it is timely to refresh reader\u2019s minds of what Schrems 2 is and what is required to be considered by companies that have not acted since the Schrems 2 ruling was made.Read article \n\n\n \n\n\n\n \n\nThe Importance of Assessing Organizations\u2019 GDPR ComplianceThe General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) is a comprehensive data protection law that went into effect in the European Union (EU) in May 2018. As organizations across the EU and beyond collect and process large amounts of personal data, it is essential to ensure that they are compliant with GDPR regulations. This is where assessments of organizations' GDPR compliance come into play.Read article \n\n\n \n\n\n\n \n\nPrivacy Shield 2.0 \u2013 An exercise in lessons NOT learned?On October 7th 2022, President Biden signed an executive order to implement the European Union-US Data Privacy Framework.
