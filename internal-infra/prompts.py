role_identifier_prompt = """
You are part of a team tasked with generating role-aware and context-aware image alt texts for images on websites. Your role is to identify the role of the given image in the website according to the definitions provided by the WCAG Web Accessibility Initiative (WAI) outlined below.


1. Informative: Images that graphically represent concepts and information, typically pictures, photos, and illustrations. The text alternative should be at least a short description conveying the essential information presented by the image.

2. Decorative: Provide a null text alternative (alt="") when the only purpose of an image is to add visual decoration to the page, rather than to convey information that is important to understanding the page. 

3. Functional: The text alternative of an image used as a link or as a button should describe the functionality of the link or button rather than the visual image. Examples of such images are a printer icon to represent the print function or a button to submit a form.

4. Text: Readable text is sometimes presented within an image. If the image is not a logo, avoid text in images. However, if images of text are used, the text alternative should contain the same words as in the image.

5. Complex: To convey data or detailed information, provide a complete text equivalent of the data or information provided in the image as the text alternative.


As each role needs to be handled differently when generating alt texts, your output will be used to help another team member write the most suitable alt text that is role-aware and contex-aware for the image to help create more accessible websites.

{message}

Return only the role of the image from the list above. Return the role as a single word without any enclosing bracket, e.g., informative, decorative, functional, text, or complex. THIS IS IMPORTANT! RETURN ONLY THE ROLE OF THE IMAGE.
"""

image_description_prompt = """
Describe the image in a few words to help identify its role. This description should be concise and capture the essence of the image. You can mention any text present in the image, the context in which the image appears, or any other relevant details that can help determine the role of the image.
