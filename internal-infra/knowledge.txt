# General Information

## AYANA History
Located within the AYANA Estate are four distinct accommodations: the AYANA Resort, AYANA Segara, AYANA Villas, and RIMBA. There is also one luxury residence, AYANA Residence.
The AYANA Resort, initially opened as the Ritz-Carlton Bali in 1996, underwent rebranding in 2009. The AYANA Villas, launched in 2005 as the Ritz-Carlton Villas, were also rebranded during the same year. RIMBA was introduced in 2013, and the latest addition, AYANA Segara or Segara for short, opened in November 2022. The general manager for all four hotels is Mr. Giordano Faggioli.

Aptly named after ‘a place of refuge’ in Sanskrit, AYANA Resort Bali is perched on limestone cliffs above the Indian Ocean near Jimbaran Bay on Bali’s southwestern peninsula. The expansive resort includes 78 free-standing private villas and a 294-room hotel set amidst lush tropical gardens. It is a wondrous retreat of culture, culinary genius, and four famed resorts. A place where earth, jungle, sky, and sea thrive in their very own ecosystem. Home to Bulbul, Hummingbirds, and 200 plant species,including the fruit-hanging tree known as Kigelia Africana, or the sausage tree. AYANA shows us what's possible when nature is given the time it needs to thrive. To step inside AYANA is to enter another world entirely.
Spread across 90 hectares of land, the resort features a treasure trove of 25 globally-recognized restaurants and bars, 14 pools, and breathtaking rooms, suites, and villas to rest your sun-kissed head. Additionally, it offers one perfect beach on its private portion of Jimbaran Bay.
## Location

### Sasi Wimba Haneng Gata Poem


The poem Sasi Wimba Haneng Gata, paired with the shimmering sounds of Wayan Gde Yudane’s composition Journey, beautifully illustrates how Bali values calm and peace as essential for gaining insight and clarity. It conveys that only in tranquil waters can the true reflection of the moon be seen, inviting you to embrace a slower, more contemplative pace as you explore the exhibit.

Feel the soul-soothing power of art as it reshapes your perceptions and stirs your emotions, enhancing your cultural experience.


### Palelintangan: Balinese Astrology


The Palelintangan, a Balinese star calendar, provides interpretations of one's star sign (lintang), helping individuals understand their personal traits. It integrates the seven-day week (Saptawara) with the five-day week (Pancawara), aligning with one's birth date.


The calendar is rich with culturally significant symbols: the top row displays the governing deity, contrasting with the bottom row, which features demons or animals as spiritual guardians. Columns one to seven represent the days of the week, while rows two to five outline the five-day week from Umanis to Kliwon, capturing 35 unique star signs
### Togog Paras: Stone Statues Collection


As you explore the first floor, discover an impressive collection of paired stone statues, spanning from the 17th to the 20th centuries.


Each set—from mystical guardians to celestial beings—captures Bali's rich cultural heritage and spiritual traditions. 
These statues serve not only to ward off evil spirits and ensure the sanctity of sacred spaces but are also celebrated for their exceptional artistic craftsmanship, showcasing the marvels of Balinese sculpture along with the rich folklore, legends, and stories they represent.


### The Gamelan Angklung of Manggis


For the Balinese, the gamelan is more than just a musical ensemble; it is a vital part of the community's spiritual and social expression. Participating in the gamelan is a communal activity that strengthens social ties and deepens religious devotion.


Our collection features a Gamelan Angklung set crafted in 1953 by the late Made Tomblos of Manggis Karangasem. Recognizing the historical and cultural significance of this ensemble, the museum acquired the full set, facilitated by I Made Sutama, Made Tomblos' grandson. This acquisition ensures the continuation of this cherished legacy
### SAKA Knowledge Center
The Knowledge Center hosts specially curated collections depicting interaction between traditional and contemporary Balinese life in extraordinary detail. With more than 490 literary works, visitors can explore the unique tapestry of Balinese culture's past and present on every page.


Discover key events that have shaped Bali as it is today on our Threads of Bali board. This display intertwines three important aspects: spiritual depth, artistic richness, and multicultural exchange. It provides a comprehensive foundation for understanding today's Balinese identity, which is deeply rooted in tradition yet dynamically modern.
### Tika: The Art of Balinese Timekeeping
Tika, Bali's traditional calendar, is designed using the precise calculations of wariga, a method for determining auspicious and inauspicious days for initiating tasks.


Stemming from the word 'kutika', meaning
'to mark', the Tika calendar is artistically represented through symbols on various media.


It is meticulously crafted on rectangular wooden boards, paper, and sometimes
even fabric, each bearing the unique mathematical intricacies of Balinese timekeeping.


### Lontar: The Art of Time-Honored Wisdom


Lontar manuscripts of Bali, ancient texts inscribed on palm leaves, are fundamental to the preservation of Balinese arts and culture. Historically used not only for communication and as daily journals, these lontars primarily functioned as repositories of sacred knowledge.  Etched with a special iron stylus (pengrupak), they encompass a broad spectrum of wisdom, including spiritual teachings, religious doctrines, historical narratives, medicinal practices, and literary compositions. Many lontars also feature exquisite calligraphy and are housed in ornately decorated boxes that protect and enhance their artistic value. 


### SAKA Auditorium 


To further enrich your appreciation of Balinese culture, we invite you to watch our series of short films, including the currently premiering film about Nyepi, in our state-of-the-art auditorium. Available in multiple languages, this is an experience not to be missed.


Experience the vivid contrasts of the Melasti, Pengerupukan, and the Day of Silence itself, each portrayed in stunning detail. Discover how the mighty ogoh-ogoh integrate into these rituals and learn about the creation process of these giant effigies from two master designers who have crafted three ogoh-ogoh for our museum.


### Ogoh-ogoh: Walking Among Giants


Ogoh-ogoh are imposing figures, crafted from materials like papier-mâché, bamboo, rattan, and wood. These creations portray intimidating entities, including demons, monsters, ogres, mythical beasts, deities, and supernatural beings.   The word ‘ogoh’ means to sway or shake. As they move, ogoh-ogoh become captivating spectacle, symbolizing bhuta-kala, a formidable force from the underworld. Their parade, which occurs on Pengerupukan Day, the eve of Nyepi, serves a significant purpose of spiritual cleansing, aimed at exorcizing evil spirits and purging negative energies from the community.


During the 1980s, the youthful expression of ogoh-ogoh transformed into street festivals throughout Bali, significantly shaping the evolution of their form and function. Today, they are not just static sculptures but interactive art pieces that can rotate, light up, emit smoke, and produce sounds, creating a captivating, multi-sensory experience for spectators.


### Fun Fact 


Komang Gede Sentana Putra (Kedux) and Ida Bagus Nyoman Surya Wigenam (Gusman Surya) are the creators behind our iconic Amuk Rahwana Lan Wilmana (The Fury of Ravana and Wilmana), the grandest ogoh-ogoh in Bali, celebrated for its imposing presence.


The 1910s photograph by renowned German doctor and photographer Gregor Krause captures one of the earliest ogoh-ogoh, depicted as dawang-dawang (guardians) used in royal cremation ceremonies, providing a historical perspective on Balinese cultural rituals.


In local banjars or hamlets, crafting an ogoh-ogoh is a community effort, engaging 50–75 youths over about one month, each contributing in various roles under the guidance of a master artist, showcasing the communal spirit and cultural richness of Bali.
