How does asbestos-driven chronic inflammation evolve into mesothelioma? What are the keymolecular events and their associated vulnerabilities?\n2. Can individuals destined to develop mesothelioma be identified at a pre-malignant stage andtherefore recruited to future intervention studies using validated response tools?\n\n\n\n\n\nNetwork aim\nTo build a Worldwide Network of mesothelioma researchers who collaborate and share knowledge and data \u2013 helping to maximise the yield of knowledge and data gathered from individual studies to better inform the overall understanding of mesothelioma.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhy\n\n\nMesothelioma is an incurable cancer that develops many decades after inhalation of asbestos dust and fibres.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMesothelioma is an incurable cancer that develops many decades after inhalation of asbestos dust and fibres. Few treatment options exist, and unfortunately most patients die within a year. A long latent period after asbestos exposure is common (30-50 years), characterized by chronic asbestos-driven pleural inflammation, but the factors that promote or permit mesothelioma evolution are poorly understood.\nCritically, mesothelioma may be preceded by a benign manifestation of pleural inflammation known as Asbestos Associated Pleural Inflammation. This presents with a fluid collection in the chest, which requires drainage and biopsies to exclude mesothelioma.\nWith the UK incidence of mesothelioma currently the highest in the world, global death rates rising rapidly (currently 43,000/year) and an epidemic predicted in the BRIC countries (Brazil, Russia, India, China) there is an urgent need to accelerate research, particularly in relation to target identification and drug development.Accurate risk prediction and response tools are also required to deliver effective early intervention trials.\nFor more information on mesothelioma please check out Mesothelioma UK\n\nMesothelioma UK Website\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow\n\nThe PREDICT-Meso Network aims to develop new research tools, resources, and infrastructure to support current and future mesothelioma research, including:\n\n\n$\n\nA website for data and knowledge sharing\n\n\n\n\n$\n\nA PREDICT-Meso specific Research Tissue Bank for sample collection, storage and access\n\n\n\n\n$\n\nNew patient derived cell lines\n\n\n\n\n$\n\nTarget-drug combinations and screening\n\n\n\n\n$\n\nMouse models\n\n\n\n\n$\n\nClinical studies\n\n\n\n\n$\n\nDevelopment of an AI algorithm for automated tumour scoring\n\n\n\n\n$\n\nLinks with BRIC countries (Brazil, Russia, India, China)- where asbestos is still widely used\n\n\n\n\n\nThe factors that promote or permit mesothelioma evolution are poorly understood, however mesothelioma may be preceded by a benign pleural inflammation. One study has shown that 12% of patients with benign effusion develop mesothelioma, and our own feasibility study supports this. Benign effusion diagnosis may provide a window of opportunity to predict mesothelioma and the PREDICT-Meso Network wishes to investigate this further via a clinical study called Meso-ORIGINS and downstream analysis of the samples gathered.\nMeso-ORIGINS is an ambitious study\u00a0to try and define\u00a0in vivo\u00a0the key biological events that drive or permit evolution of mesothelioma,\u00a0and subsequently allow\u00a0development of more effective treatments and earlier interventions for the disease.\nMeso-ORIGINS will recruit\u00a0patients with benign asbestos associated pleural inflammation and follow their progression over 2 years, collecting repeat tissue samples in the minority who develop mesothelioma, and a sample of those who do not.\nCreating these unique matched benign/mesothelioma tissue pairs and aligning\u00a0these with world-class pre-clinical research, will\u00a0allow us to define the driving (oncological) and/or permissive (immunological) events involved in the development of mesothelioma.\nThis data will the influence testing of targeted drugs and hopefully help us define better treatments for mesothelioma.\nFor more information of the Meso-ORIGINS study, please see the Meso-ORIGINS page.\nAn aim of the Network is to collaborate and share knowledge and data \u2013 helping to maximising the yield of knowledge and data gathered from individual sites and studies to better inform the overall understanding of mesothelioma.

Few treatment options exist, and unfortunately most patients die within a year. A long latent period after asbestos exposure is common (30-50 years), characterized by chronic asbestos-driven pleural inflammation, but the factors that promote or permit mesothelioma evolution are poorly understood.\nCritically, mesothelioma may be preceded by a benign manifestation of pleural inflammation known as Asbestos Associated Pleural Inflammation. This presents with a fluid collection in the chest, which requires drainage and biopsies to exclude mesothelioma.\nWith the UK incidence of mesothelioma currently the highest in the world, global death rates rising rapidly (currently 43,000/year) and an epidemic predicted in the BRIC countries (Brazil, Russia, India, China) there is an urgent need to accelerate research, particularly in relation to target identification and drug development.Accurate risk prediction and response tools are also required to deliver effective early intervention trials.\nFor more information on mesothelioma please check out Mesothelioma UK\n\nMesothelioma UK Website\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow\n\nThe PREDICT-Meso Network aims to develop new research tools, resources, and infrastructure to support current and future mesothelioma research, including:\n\n\n$\n\nA website for data and knowledge sharing\n\n\n\n\n$\n\nA PREDICT-Meso specific Research Tissue Bank for sample collection, storage and access\n\n\n\n\n$\n\nNew patient derived cell lines\n\n\n\n\n$\n\nTarget-drug combinations and screening\n\n\n\n\n$\n\nMouse models\n\n\n\n\n$\n\nClinical studies\n\n\n\n\n$\n\nDevelopment of an AI algorithm for automated tumour scoring\n\n\n\n\n$\n\nLinks with BRIC countries (Brazil, Russia, India, China)- where asbestos is still widely used\n\n\n\n\n\nThe factors that promote or permit mesothelioma evolution are poorly understood, however mesothelioma may be preceded by a benign pleural inflammation.
