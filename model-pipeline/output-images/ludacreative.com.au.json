Thank goodness she did, I landed with the most amazing, patient person ever. I had so many questions and changes along the way and Kali helped guide me through it all. She added in pages that I needed to have and didn't have on my existing website and even created an events page when I let her know I was going to be attending Expo's, something I hadn't even thought about. I love my new website, I'm so proud now to send people to it to see what I offer.
