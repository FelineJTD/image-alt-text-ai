Our team has years of experience in homecare software, billing, claims management, payroll entry, and management. We provide onsite and remote demos and unlimited training at no extra charge. We do not feel the need to lock agencies into a lengthy contract (our contracts are month to month with a 30-day notice). Our software and support speak for themselves and set us aside from other software companies. The AllCare team does not assign tickets when our agencies require support. We provide our agencies with direct line contact to help resolve all questions and issues immediately. Our team members have been highly trained and are continuously updated on the changes made by DHS to better support you. Our reliable, accountable team is available to serve our agency partners effectively and efficiently.\n\n\n\n\n\nRecent\u00a0 updates\n\n\n\n\n\nMHCA Expo 2023 at Breezy Point Resort, MN\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nScott Millette\n\n\n\n\n\nLisa Luger,\u00a0 Aaron Luger.
