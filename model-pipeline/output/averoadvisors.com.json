Avero excelled in this aspect. Technically strong, depth of knowledge, and an ability to speak in a language management can understand. They don\u2019t use only industry terms. They took us through some discovery to make sure we got the scope right.

We\u2019re prepared now to move and be able to do a lot of things. You all have been a tremendous asset for me to be able to lean on. I have to say this, if there\u2019s anybody out there reading if you all need help in your counties, Avero Advisors are family. They\u2019re not another business trying to make a buck. They care about the people that need help and they want to be there. I mean that from the bottom of my heart.\u201d\n \nTom Hatcher\nCircuit Court Clerk \nBlount County, Tennessee\nHow Av\u00e8ro Helped Blount County, Tennessee Modernize its IT infrastructure, How Av\u00e8ro Helped Blount County, Tennessee Modernize its IT infrastructure\n\n\u201cAv\u00e8ro is a knowledgeable, agile, and energetic partner who blends experience with teamwork to help develop solutions. They gave the county a very clear understanding of our strengths and weaknesses through an IT Strategic Plan. Also, a strong list of solutions across both the time required to implement and cost to implement spectrums. Av\u00e8ro is a comfortable and trusted partner in this large endeavor that crosses many departments and stakeholders.\u201d\n \nNicholas Morris\nProject Manager\nPittsylvania County\nHow an IT Strategic Plan Elevated Pittsylvania County\u2019s IT Infrastructure, How an IT Strategic Plan Elevated Pittsylvania County\u2019s IT Infrastructure\n\n\u201cAv\u00e8ro is an excellent resource in the IT governance space. They are clear communicators, honest, and have a wide range of technical expertise. They assisted with implementing project management into our IT department, gave us an understanding of the importance of responsibility delineation, and vendor management. The Av\u00e8ro team is excellent to work with and go the extra mile to provide quality work to their clients.\u201d\n\n \nChristopher Liersaph\nAssistant Director of IT\nUnion County\nHow Union County Leveraged an Infrastructure Strategic Plan for its IT Department, How Union County Leveraged an Infrastructure Strategic Plan for its IT Department\n\n\u201cAv\u00e8ro Advisors completed two projects with us and has another one underway. I find they have two critically important attributes that speak well for them: communication skills and technical knowledge. The Av\u00e8ro team builds trust and relationships with our staff enabling comfortable communication about IT issues. By using ordinary English and humor, the Av\u00e8ro team can speak to different levels including our \u2018front line\u2019 employees, our managers, our IT staff, and our executives because they understand that most people do not speak \u2018IT.\u2019 Their technical knowledge is superb and always beneficial to us. Both of these attributes are critical to successful projection completion.\u201d\n \nTerry McKee\nIT and Procurement Director\nKnoxville\u2019s Community Development Corporation\nBridging the IT Gap: How Av\u00e8ro Transformed KCDC\u2019s Tech Infrastructure, Bridging the IT Gap: How Av\u00e8ro Transformed KCDC\u2019s Tech Infrastructure\n\n\u201cAv\u00e8ro Advisors has brought IT advancements to Blount County Government that were 30 years overdue. This modernization process could have been a lot more painful had it not been for the ability of Av\u00e8ro to build strong relationships that have endured through the entire process. This has been so important for our employees to embrace these changes and move forward with confidence in implementing multiple upgrades in a short time frame.\u201d\n \nEd Mitchell\nMayor\nBlount County, Tennessee\nHow Av\u00e8ro Helped Blount County, Tennessee Modernize its IT infrastructure, How Av\u00e8ro Helped Blount County, Tennessee Modernize its IT infrastructure\n\n\u201cWe are in year two of a five-year project. Our experience has been very positive. Av\u00e8ro performed at the highest level of satisfaction from the department directors and myself, as Deputy City Manager of Operations. Av\u00e8ro is collaborative, engaged, and able to break the status quo of typical governance. Charlottesville\u2019s Av\u00e8ro team broke down decades of silos and secrecy to elicit important information out of long-tenured employees. This was critical to the success of process redesign and automation.\u201d\n \nPaul Oberdorfer\nEx-Deputy City Manager\nCity of Charlottesville\nModernizing Business Practices with the City of Charlottesville, Virginia, Modernizing Business Practices with the City of Charlottesville, Virginia\n\n\u201cOur agency is 100% paper-based and no one on staff had the experience procuring an EDMS solution. Moving forward knowing we were not experienced would have been a risk. Avero had the industry knowledge that we were looking for. Not only did they have experience procuring EDMS solutions and implementing them, but they had worked with Public Housing Authorities before.\nWorking with Avero gives our agency the confidence that we will make the best overall decision when choosing an EDMS solution. Avero has staff readily available to answer questions and address concerns.\u201d\n \nSamantha Arellano\nIT Manager\nReno Housing Authority, NV\nTransforming Reno Housing Authority\u2019s Document Management System, Transforming Reno Housing Authority\u2019s Document Management System, Transforming Reno Housing Authority\u2019s Document Management System\n\n\u201cAs you know, many companies are technically strong in all things IT but not every firm can build the relationships necessary to help an organization navigate change.
